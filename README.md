# my-machine-learning-projects
Repository for all my Machine Learning (COEN 240) projects under Prof. Alex Sumarsono. 

- Project 1  *train a linear regression model using a dataset that contains a collection of real estate listings in San Luis Obispo county. Given the square footage, the model can then predict the price of the house.
- Project 2 *Object Detection: The objectives of this assignment are the following: * Train one or more detection models via transfer learning. * Evaluate hyperparameter choices and how they affect the learning. Use the validation set to validate parameter choices. * Choose the best model, i.e., best classifier + best hyper-parameter choices.
- Project 3  *Audio Classification: The objectives of this assignment are the following: *Experiment with different audio feature extraction techniques. *Create a Deep Learning-based audio clip classifier (RNN or Transformer-based 
model).
- Final Project  *Evaluate and attempt to improve one or more state-of-the-art Deep Learning
algorithms/models on one or more large dataset(s). The algorithm should be chosen from recently
published papers (last 2-3 years) from select conferences (KDD, ICML, ICDM,CIKM,CVPR,NEURIPS,AAAI)
