# my-machine-learning-projects
Repository for all my Machine Learning (COEN 240) projects under Prof. Alex Sumarsono. 

- Project 1  *Train a linear regression model using a dataset that contains a collection of real estate listings in San Luis Obispo county. Given the square footage, the model can then predict the price of the house.
- Project 2  *Train a model using the modified 4-dimensional, 2-class Iris dataset and perform Logistic Regression with Batch Gradient Descent.
- Project 3  *Implement a Minimum Risk Bayes Theoretic classifier. Train the classifier using the 4-dimensional, 2-class Iris training set and determine the classification accuracy using the validation set. Print the actual and predicted class labels. Print the average classification accuracy. Average accuracy should be at least 90%.
- Project 4  *Implement the K-means unsupervised learning algorithm and Use the simplified Iris dataset to test your code. Show the cluster assignment of each sample and the two centroids in a plot.
- Project 5  *Implement dimensionality reduction using PCA with eigen decomposition.
- Project 6  *Build a fully-connected neural network (MLP) to provide some obstacle avoidance capability in Robo-Car . The controller receives distance information from the sensor and sends the status to the MLP. The MLP supplies the command to the controller, which in turn controls the motor. 
- Final Project  *Select a machine learning topic that interests you. Find high quality references to support your research topic. Find high quality references to support your research topic (journal/conference papers, textbooks, lectures, podcasts etc). Write & run your code to solve a specific problem related to your topic
